# Bank-Loan-Default-Prediction
This project intends to address the ongoing issue of loan payment default that financial institutions deal with on a daily basis. Based on a person's credit score and other information supplied by them, my team and I created three machine learning models that may be used as a reference tool to determine if that person would miss a loan payment.These models will assist financial organisations in deciding whether to grant the loan or not in order to reduce risk and increase profit.
